The table below summarizes the requested metrics for the five highest-downloaded pure‐Python libraries (with 2025 releases). Download rankings (PyPI) place boto3, urllib3, setuptools, certifi, and charset‐normalizer in the top 5 of pure-Python packages. Each had a 2025 release (as cited below), and all have public GitHub repos. We list the date of the last 2025 release, GitHub contributors, code coverage (from any Codecov badge, or “N/A” if none is provided), open issues, and approximate repo size (LOC).

Library	Last release (2025)	Contributors (GitHub)	Code coverage (%)	Open issues (GitHub)	Repo size (approx LOC)
boto3	Jun 6, 2025 ￼	146 ￼	N/A	172 ￼	~70 000
urllib3	Apr 10, 2025 ￼	331 ￼	N/A	130 ￼	~11 000
setuptools	May 27, 2025 ￼	545 ￼	N/A	597 ￼	~61 000
certifi	Apr 26, 2025 ￼	40 ￼	N/A	5 ￼	~130
charset-normalizer	May 2, 2025 ￼	20 ￼	N/A	0 ￼	~2 000

Each “Last release” date is from the PyPI project page (2025) ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼. “Contributors” and “Open issues” counts are from the GitHub repo headers ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼. No Codecov coverage badges were present, so coverage is marked “N/A.” The repo sizes are rough estimates in lines of code (LOC). (Boto3 and setuptools are large SDKs – ~70k and ~61k LOC – while urllib3 and charset-normalizer are much smaller; certifi is tiny.)

Sources: Package release pages and GitHub repository pages as cited above. Each referenced line shows the release date, contributor count, or issue count on the linked page.
