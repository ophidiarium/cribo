## üõ†Ô∏è PROJECT TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Project Overview

Cribo is a Python source bundler written in Rust that produces a single .py file from a multi-module Python project by inlining first-party source files. It's available as a CLI tool.

Key features:

- Tree-shaking to include only needed modules
- Unused import detection and trimming
- Requirements.txt generation
- Configurable import classification

### Build Commands

#### Rust Binary

```bash
# Development build
cargo build

# Release build
cargo build --release

# Run the tool directly
cargo run --package cribo --bin cribo -- --entry path/to/main.py --output bundle.py
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run with code coverage
cargo llvm-cov --json
```

### Architecture Overview

The project is organized as a Rust workspace with the main crate in `crates/cribo`.

#### Key Components

1. **Module Resolution & Import Classification** (`resolver.rs`)
   - Classifies imports as standard library, first-party, or third-party
   - Resolves actual file paths for bundling

2. **Dependency Graph** (`dependency_graph.rs`)
   - Builds a directed graph of module dependencies
   - Uses topological sorting to determine bundling order

3. **AST Parsing & Rewriting** (various files)
   - Uses Ruff's Python AST parser (`ruff_python_parser`) for AST parsing
   - Implements AST rewriting to handle import statements

4. **Unused Import Detection** (`unused_imports_simple.rs`)
   - Detects and removes unused imports
   - Handles various import formats (simple, from, aliased)

5. **Code Generation** (`emit.rs`)
   - Generates the final bundled Python file
   - Maintains code structure with proper formatting
