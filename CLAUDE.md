# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Serpen is a Python source bundler written in Rust that produces a single .py file from a multi-module Python project by inlining first-party source files. It's available as both a CLI tool and a Python library via PyPI and npm.

Key features:

- Tree-shaking to include only needed modules
- Unused import detection and trimming
- Requirements.txt generation
- Configurable import classification
- PYTHONPATH and VIRTUAL_ENV support

## Build Commands

### Rust Binary

```bash
# Development build
cargo build

# Release build
cargo build --release

# Run the tool directly
cargo run -- --entry path/to/main.py --output bundle.py
```

### Python Package

```bash
# Build for development (creates a local installable package)
uvx maturin develop

# Build release package
uvx maturin build --release
```

### npm Package

```bash
# Generate npm packages
node scripts/generate-npm-packages.js

# Build npm binaries
./scripts/build-npm-binaries.sh
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run specific test file
cargo test --package serpen --test integration_tests

# Run tests matching a pattern
cargo test --package serpen unused_imports

# Run a specific named test
cargo test --package serpen test_simple_project_bundling
```

## Coverage Commands

```bash
# Text coverage report
cargo coverage-text
# or
./scripts/coverage.sh coverage

# HTML coverage report (opens in browser)
cargo coverage
# or
./scripts/coverage.sh coverage-html

# LCOV format (for CI tools)
cargo coverage-lcov
# or
./scripts/coverage.sh coverage-lcov
```

## Architecture Overview

The project is organized as a Rust workspace with the main crate in `crates/serpen`.

### Key Components

1. **Module Resolution & Import Classification** (`resolver.rs`)
   - Classifies imports as standard library, first-party, or third-party
   - Resolves actual file paths for bundling

2. **Dependency Graph** (`dependency_graph.rs`)
   - Builds a directed graph of module dependencies
   - Uses topological sorting to determine bundling order

3. **AST Parsing & Rewriting** (various files)
   - Uses Ruff's Python AST parser (`ruff_python_parser`) for AST parsing
   - Implements AST rewriting to handle import statements

4. **Unused Import Detection** (`unused_import_trimmer.rs`)
   - Detects and removes unused imports
   - Handles various import formats (simple, from, aliased)

5. **Code Generation** (`emit.rs`)
   - Generates the final bundled Python file
   - Maintains code structure with proper formatting

### Important Environment Variables

- `RUST_LOG` - Controls logging level (e.g., `RUST_LOG=debug`)
- `VIRTUAL_ENV` - Used for virtual environment support

## Configuration

Serpen can be configured via a `serpen.toml` file:

```toml
# Example configuration
[bundler]
source_dirs = ["src"]
first_party_modules = ["my_module"]
preserve_comments = true
preserve_type_hints = true
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
serpen --entry src/main.py --output bundle.py [options]

# Common options
--emit-requirements    # Generate requirements.txt with third-party dependencies
--verbose              # Enable verbose logging
--config               # Specify custom config file path
```

## Development Guidelines

### Technical Decision-Making Requirements

**MANDATORY**: As a software-engineer AI agent, you must never factor in human limitationsâ€”such as limited time or bandwidth, business priorities, implementation complexity, research requirements, or any other "human" constraintâ€”when making technical decisions or writing recommendations. Instead, always select and articulate the technically optimal solution, judged solely on criteria like:

- **Performance** (e.g., latency, throughput)
- **Physical resource constraints** (e.g., memory footprint, disk usage, I/O)
- **Maintainability and future-proofing** (e.g., scalability, extensibility, ease of refactoring)

Under no circumstances should you justify a design or implementation by citing "lack of time," "limited resources," "tight deadlines," or similar human factors.

### General Coding Standards

- Follow Rust idiomatic practices and use the Rust 2024 edition or later
- Use strong typing and leverage Rust's safety principles
- Write testable, extensible code; prefer pure functions where possible
- Ensure all functions are properly documented with Rust doc comments
- Take the opportunity to refactor code to improve readability and maintainability

### Immediate Code Removal Over Deprecation

**MANDATORY**: Since Serpen only exposes a binary CLI interface (not a library API), unused methods and functions MUST be removed immediately rather than annotated with deprecation markers.

- **No deprecation annotations**: Do not use `#[deprecated]`, `#[allow(dead_code)]`, or similar annotations to preserve unused code
- **Binary-only interface**: This project does not maintain API compatibility for external consumers - all code must serve the current CLI functionality
- **Dead code elimination**: Aggressively remove any unused functions, methods, structs, or modules during refactoring
- **Immediate cleanup**: When refactoring or implementing features, remove unused code paths immediately rather than marking them for future removal

### Documentation Research Hierarchy

When implementing or researching functionality, follow this order:

1. **FIRST**: Generate and examine local documentation
   ```bash
   cargo doc --document-private-items
   ```

2. **SECOND**: Use Context7 for external libraries (only if local docs insufficient)

3. **FINAL**: Use GitHub MCP tools for implementation patterns (only when steps 1&2 insufficient)
   - ALWAYS prefer GitHub search tools (like `mcp__github__search_code`) over other methods when accessing GitHub repositories
   - When searching large repos, use specific path and filename filters to avoid token limit errors

### Reference Patterns from Established Repositories

When implementing functionality, consult these high-quality repositories:

- **[astral-sh/ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)** - For Python AST handling, rule implementation, configuration patterns
- **[astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** - For package resolution, dependency management, Python ecosystem integration
- **[web-infra-dev/rspack](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack)** - For module graph construction, dependency resolution

### Snapshot Testing with Insta

Accept new or updated snapshots using:

```bash
cargo insta accept
```

DO NOT use `cargo insta review` as that requires interactive input.

### Coverage Requirements

- Run baseline coverage check before implementing features:
  ```bash
  cargo coverage-text  # Get current coverage baseline
  ```
- Ensure coverage doesn't drop by more than 2% for any file or overall project
- New files should aim for >90% line coverage
- Critical paths should have 100% coverage for error handling and edge cases

### Workflow Best Practices

- Always run tests and clippy after implementing a feature to make sure everything is working as expected
- **ALWAYS fix all clippy errors in the code you editing after finishing implementing a feature**

### MANDATORY: Final Validation Before Claiming Success

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT ðŸš¨**: Before claiming that any implementation is complete or successful, you MUST run the complete validation suite:

```bash
# 1. Run all tests in the workspace
cargo test --workspace

# 2. Run clippy on all targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets

# 3. Fix any clippy errors or warnings
# NEVER use #[allow] annotations as a "fix" - do actual refactoring
```

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: Do not declare success, claim completion, or say "implementation is working" without running both commands above and ensuring they pass without errors. This applies to:

- Feature implementations
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Any code changes

If tests fail or clippy reports issues, the implementation is NOT complete until these are resolved.

## Memories

- Don't add timing complexity estimation to any documents - you don't know the team velocity
- When running on MacOs you should try `gsed` instead of `sed` - this is Homebrew installed formula gnu-sed which aligns with sed latest features
- MANDATORY when asked to fix a clippy issue never treat `#[allow]` annotation as a fix - do actual refactoring to fix the problem
- **Dead code removal**: Remove unused code immediately rather than using `#[allow(dead_code)]` or `#[deprecated]` annotations - this project only exposes a CLI interface and doesn't need API compatibility
