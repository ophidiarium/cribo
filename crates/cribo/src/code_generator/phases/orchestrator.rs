//! Bundle Orchestrator
//!
//! This module provides the high-level orchestration of all bundling phases.
//! The `BundleOrchestrator` demonstrates how the extracted phases work together.

/// High-level orchestrator for the bundling process
///
/// The orchestrator demonstrates the phase-based architecture introduced
/// in this refactoring. Each phase has been extracted into a separate,
/// testable component with clear responsibilities.
///
/// Current Implementation Note:
/// Phase extraction is complete (Phases 1-6), but full orchestration
/// integration is deferred to allow for careful lifetime management.
/// The existing `bundle_modules()` method continues to serve as the
/// primary entry point while demonstrating identical logic flow.
///
/// Future Work:
/// Complete the orchestration by resolving Rust lifetime constraints
/// between phases, allowing `bundle_modules` to fully delegate to this
/// orchestrator.

impl BundleOrchestrator {

    ///
    /// This method would orchestrate all phases of bundling:
    /// 1. Initialization: Setup and future imports collection
    /// 2. Preparation: Module trimming and AST indexing
    /// 3. Classification: Separate inlinable vs wrapper modules
    /// 4. Symbol Rename Collection: Gather renames from semantic analysis
    /// 5. Global Symbol Collection: Extract global symbols
    /// 6. Processing: Main module processing loop
    /// 7. Entry Module Processing: Special handling for entry module
    /// 8. Post-Processing: Namespace attachment, proxy generation, aliases
    /// 9. Finalization: Assemble final module and log statistics
    ///
    /// Note: Currently delegates to `bundle_modules` for production use.
    /// The phases have been extracted and tested, proving the architecture works.
    ///
    /// Returns the final bundled `ModModule`.
